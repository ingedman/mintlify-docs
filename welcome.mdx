## What is AdoraPlan?

AdoraPlan is a worship planning platform built specifically for churches. It brings together everything your team touches every week into a single workspace:

- **Hymn Library** — Structured lyrics, multi-language support, and a built-in community hymnary of public domain hymns
- **Service Programs** — Drag-and-drop service order editor with automatic duration tracking
- **Team & Roster** — Availability calendars, role assignments, and rotation scheduling
- **Presentation Mode** — Project lyrics directly from your song library, controlled from your phone
- **Reports & Insights** — Song rotation analytics, volunteer activity, and service trends
- **Multi-Site Management** — One organization, multiple church locations, shared resources

<Info>
  AdoraPlan is a web app — no installation needed. It works in any modern browser on desktop, tablet, or phone.

## How to Use These Docs

### If you're brand new

Start with **[Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start)** — you'll have your church set up, your first songs added, and your first service planned in under 5 minutes.

Then follow the **[Onboarding Guide](/getting-started/onboarding)** to walk through inviting your team and filling out your organization structure.

### If you're looking for a specific feature

Use the **left sidebar** to navigate by module — Hymns, Programs, Roster, Calendar, Presentation, and more. Each section covers the full workflow for that feature, from basic use to advanced configuration.

### If you're an admin or platform operator

The **[Admin & Platform](/admin/overview)** section covers user management, catalog configuration, billing, and platform-level controls. These pages are role-gated in the app and marked clearly here.

### If you're troubleshooting

Jump to **[FAQ](/faq)** or search the docs using the search bar at the top. Most common questions around billing, plan limits, and feature access are answered there.

<Tip>
  Use `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows) to search the docs from anywhere.

## Understanding Plans & Feature Access

AdoraPlan has three tiers: **Free**, **Pro** ($19.99/mo), and **Max** ($49.99/mo). Some features and resource limits vary by plan.

Throughout these docs, you'll see callouts like this:

<Note>
  **Pro plan required.** Presentation Mode is available on Pro and Max plans. [See pricing →](https://adoraplan.lovable.app/pricing)
</Note>

These callouts appear inline so you always know what's available on your current plan before you go looking for a feature in the app.

| Plan | Songs | Programs | Team Members | Key Features |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Free** | 25 | 10 | 5 | Hymn library, service editor, team scheduling |
| **Pro** | 500 | 100 | 25 | + Presentation mode, PDF export, advanced reports |
| **Max** | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited | + Multi-church (up to 10), unlimited everything |

## A Few Things Worth Knowing Upfront

**Your data is always yours.** Songs, programs, and team records belong to your organization. If you ever downgrade, your data is preserved — access is limited by plan, but nothing is deleted.

**CCLI licensing is your responsibility.** AdoraPlan is a planning tool, not a licensing service. The community hymnary contains public domain hymns you can use freely. For copyrighted songs, make sure you hold the appropriate CCLI or equivalent license. [Learn more →](/legal/ccli-compliance)

**Invited team members skip the setup wizard.** When you invite collaborators, they join your existing workspace directly — they won't need to set up an organization or church. [See how invitations work →](/team/inviting-members)
